# 🧪 Mini Projects

This folder includes hands-on projects where OOP concepts are used to simulate real-world scenarios.

### 📁 Project Ideas

| Project | Concepts Used |
|--------|----------------|
| `student-manager/` | Classes, encapsulation, vectors |
| `bank-simulator/` | Inheritance, polymorphism |
| `inventory-tracker/` | File I/O, object lists |

Each project contains its own:
- `main.cpp`
- `README.md` (project-specific)
- Supporting header/source files

These projects help transition from "learning syntax" to "designing systems".
